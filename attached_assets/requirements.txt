Build a small, full-stack appointment booking app:
Frontend: React (UI for customers to book; UI for client to manage)

Backend: Node/Express (REST API), or language/framework of your choice (bonus for TypeScript or familiar stack)

No auth required. Use in-memory or local file/database for storage.

üö¶ Requirements

1. Customer Side
See available appointment slots for the week.



Book a single slot (provide name, email, reason).

If slot is taken, prevent double-booking.

Get clear feedback: success or error (slot already booked, missing info).

2. Client Side (Business Admin)
View all booked appointments.



Approve or deny each (pending by default).

Denied slots become available for re-booking.

Bonus: Filter by status (pending/approved/denied).

3. Backend API
Endpoints to list slots, create booking, update booking status.



Edge cases: return proper error for invalid/missing data, booking conflicts, etc.

‚ö° Extra Credit
Calendar Sync: Simulate sending an email or ‚Äúcalendar invite‚Äù (just log to console or render a message).

CSV Export: Button for client to download all bookings as CSV.

Live Updates: Polling or websockets to auto-refresh the list.

Basic tests: One or two test cases for critical API endpoints.

üì¶ Data Simulation
Generate a week‚Äôs worth of appointment slots (e.g., M-F, 9am‚Äì5pm, 30-min intervals) on backend boot, or as a seed script.

Store bookings in memory or (bonus) in a simple local DB (SQLite, JSON, etc).

üßπ Engineering Best Practices
Git: Commit frequently (each logical unit). Add a clear, brief README:

Project overview

How to run backend & frontend

Sample API calls or demo data

Short note on architecture/structure

Code Structure: Use clear separation (MVC or folders for routes/controllers/services if possible).

Error Handling: Return descriptive errors (status + message).

UI: Focus on clarity and minimalism, not design polish.

üö´ What You DON‚ÄôT Need
No authentication.

No payment integrations.

No production database or deployment.

No external APIs required (besides maybe nodemailer for a fake invite).
